DNA folding against transcription optimization rules (Evolving Genetic Regulatory Networks)

Abstract

The regulation of transcription is one of the basic mechanisms of life, it is essential for cell adaptation to environmental stress, the mechanisms of this regulation are still poorly understood. This project aims to inform the optimization of the placement of genes along the chromosomes. We have developed a new model of artificial regulatory networks which allowed us to obtain a proof of concept of the validity of chromosomes solenoid model.
